# imdbSim-Sim
A gateway to IMDB data

Firstly a big shout-out to "richardasaurus" for imdb-pie coz this whole project is based on this python library only.

imdbSim-Sim is a Django application which uses imdbpie library to get the data from IMDB.com.
I prefer to use virtual environment and the devise the whole project on it, so my initial commit includes a working virtual environment which one can use directly..

STATUS: Currently under progress and soon to be completed!!
